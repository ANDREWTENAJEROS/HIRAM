                Many people have had many personal items but thought of having found no use of them anymore and thus having no idea of what to do of it, they could just put it up for sale, dispose of it or give it to someone else, but deep within them, they have thoughts of using them again and don’t plan on relinquishing it, and so with this renting platform called Hiram, people can now have their personal belongings to be lent to someone else for a price, of course. With Hiram, people can rent items of their choosing, be it for academic usage or personal usage for a certain amount of time.                </div>
